## 💰 Effort Estimate

### If I Build Everything:
```
Auth Flow (8 screens):        ~2-3 hours
Rider Core Flow (15 screens): ~4-5 hours
Rider Full App (45 screens):  ~12-15 hours
Driver App (61 screens):      ~20-25 hours
Total for 106 screens:        ~35-45 hours of work
```

### If You Build with My Templates:
```
Initial setup:                ~1 hour (me)
You build remaining screens:  ~20-30 hours (you)
Using the patterns I provide
```
