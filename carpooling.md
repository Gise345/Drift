**Drift in Cayman -- Decentralized Private Carpooling Platform**

**Official Business Plan (2026 Edition)**

**Company:** Drift in Cayman Ltd.\
**Website:** [www.drift-global.com](https://www.drift-global.com)\
**Contact:** contact@drift-global.com\
**Jurisdiction:** Cayman Islands

**1. Executive Summary**

**Overview:**\
Drift is a **peer-to-peer carpooling and mobility platform** connecting
drivers and passengers for **private, cost-sharing rides** across the
Cayman Islands.\
Unlike traditional taxi or rideshare companies, **Drift does not provide
transportation services** --- it simply enables private individuals to
connect and share trips through a **neutral digital marketplace**.

**Vision:**\
To make mobility in the Cayman Islands more affordable, efficient, and
sustainable --- without conflicting with existing transport regulations.

**Mission:**\
To empower Cayman residents, visitors, and drivers with a **legal,
community-driven mobility platform** that reduces congestion and expands
access to safe, convenient transportation options.

**Key Differentiator:**\
Drift operates as a **decentralized carpooling platform**, not a
for-hire service. This structure allows:

-   Independent drivers (private citizens) to share rides legally

-   Licensed taxi drivers to supplement income through the same platform

-   Users to engage in transparent, voluntary, private ride agreements

**Tagline:**\
*"Connecting People. Not Operating Vehicles."*

**2. The Problem**

**Regulatory Landscape**

Ride-hailing (Uber-style) operations are currently prohibited in the
Cayman Islands under the Public Transport Act, which requires all
passenger transport for hire to be performed by **licensed taxis**.

**Market Gap**

-   Residents and tourists lack affordable, flexible, app-based
    transport options.

-   Licensed taxis are limited by fare regulations and high operating
    costs.

-   No legal avenue exists for independent individuals to share rides or
    earn income via driving.

**Result**

A market where **demand for flexible mobility** exists --- but cannot be
served by rideshare operators without violating transport laws.

**3. The Solution**

**Drift's Legal Innovation**

Drift redefines local mobility by facilitating **private carpooling**,
not commercial transport.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How It Works:**

-   Drivers list their availability in the app.

-   Passengers request rides to nearby destinations.

-   The app suggests matches based on proximity and shared routes.

-   Any payments exchanged are **private, voluntary contributions**, not
    fares.

-   Drift does not employ, contract, or manage drivers --- it provides
    technology only.

**Example Driver Models**
