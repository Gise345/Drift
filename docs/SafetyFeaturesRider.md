**How to add contacts:**
1. Go to **Profile > Emergency Contacts**
2. Tap **Add Contact**
3. Enter their name, phone, and relationship
4. They'll be notified if you ever press SOS or don't respond to a safety alert

**Tip:** Add at least 2 contacts who are likely to have their phone nearby.

### Review Your Driver

Before accepting a ride, you can see:
- Driver's safety rating (how other riders rated their safety)
- Their overall rating
- How long they've been driving with Drift
- Vehicle information

## During Your Trip

### Speed Monitoring

You'll see a speed display during your trip showing:
- Current speed (in mph)
- Speed limit for the road
- Color indicator:
  - **Green** = Normal speed
  - **Yellow** = Slightly over limit
  - **Red** = Significantly over limit

If the driver is consistently speeding, the speed display will pulse red to alert you.

### Route Tracking

Drift monitors your driver's route. If they deviate significantly from the planned path:

1. You'll get a popup: **"Route Changed - Are You Okay?"**
2. You have two options:
   - **"I'm Okay"** - If the driver communicated the change or you're comfortable
   - **"SOS"** - If you feel unsafe

**Important:** You have 60 seconds to respond. If you don't respond, we'll automatically alert your emergency contacts.

### SOS Button

A red SOS button is always visible during your trip.

**To use it:**
1. Press and hold for 2 seconds (prevents accidental activation)
2. The app will:
   - Call 911
   - Send your location to emergency contacts
   - Share driver and vehicle info
   - Hold your payment

**When to use it:** Only in genuine emergencies when you feel your safety is at risk.

### Share Your Trip

Share your ride in real-time with anyone:

1. Tap **Share Trip** during your ride
2. Choose contacts to share with
3. They'll receive a link showing:
   - Your live location
   - Driver info
   - Estimated arrival time
