## Speed Monitoring

### Q: How accurate is the speed monitoring?

- A rider reports unsafe speeding
- Severe speeding (20+ mph over) occurs

### Q: Can I see the speed limit the app is using?

**A:** Riders can see the current speed limit on screen during trips. Drivers can view trip speed data afterward.
