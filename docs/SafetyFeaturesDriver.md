## How Safety Monitoring Works

### Speed Monitoring

**What We Monitor:**
- Your speed is tracked via GPS during trips
- Speed limits are obtained from mapping services
- All speed data is logged

**Alert Levels:**
- **Green (Normal):** Within speed limit
- **Yellow (Warning):** 3-6 mph over limit
- **Red (Danger):** 6+ mph over limit

**What Triggers a Violation:**
- Exceeding speed limit by 6+ mph
- Sustained for 10+ consecutive seconds
- 3+ violations in a single trip may result in a strike

**What Riders See:**
- Real-time speed and limit during trips
- Visual alerts when speeding

### Route Tracking

**What We Monitor:**
- Your location is compared to the planned route every 15 seconds
- Deviation is measured as distance from the expected path

**What Triggers an Alert:**
- Deviation of 0.5+ miles from planned route
- Deviation lasting 2+ minutes

**What Happens:**
1. Rider receives "Are you okay?" popup
2. Rider has 60 seconds to respond
3. If rider selects "SOS" or doesn't respond:
   - Their emergency contacts are notified
   - Your account is flagged for review
   - Payment is held

**Best Practice:** If you need to take a different route, communicate this to your rider before deviating.

### Trip Completion Monitoring

**What We Monitor:**
- Your location when you mark a trip complete
- Distance from the planned destination

**What Triggers an Alert:**
- Completing trip 0.3+ miles from destination

**What Happens:**
1. Rider receives confirmation popup
2. Payment held until rider confirms
3. If rider doesn't confirm or selects SOS, payment voided and account flagged

## The Three-Strike System

### Understanding Strikes

Strikes are issued for safety violations. They are the primary accountability mechanism.

### What Causes Strikes

| Violation | Severity | Strike Likelihood |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| 3+ speed violations in one trip | Medium | High |
| Route deviation + SOS | High | Very High |
| Route deviation + no response | Medium | High |
| Early completion + SOS | High | Very High |
| Verified rider safety report | Varies | Based on report |

### Strike Progression

| Strike | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| **1st Strike** | Warning notification. Strike remains on record for 30 days. |
| **2nd Strike** | 7-day account suspension. Cannot accept rides during suspension. |
| **3rd Strike** | Permanent account termination. All pending payments voided. |

### Strike Expiration

- Strikes expire **30 days (1 month)** after issuance
- Only if no new violations occur during this period
- Expired strikes are removed from your active count
- You can track expiration dates in your Safety Dashboard

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if I need to take a different route due to traffic?

**A:** Communicate this to your rider before deviating. You can say "Taking alternate route due to traffic ahead." If they're okay with it and respond "I'm Okay" to any alert, you're fine.

### Q: What if the GPS shows wrong speed?

**A:** GPS-based speed can have small errors. The system accounts for this by:
- Using 6+ mph over limit threshold

### Q: Can strikes be removed?

**A:** Yes, through:
- Successful appeal
- Natural expiration (30 days of good driving)

### Q: What if a rider makes a false report?

**A:** Submit an appeal with your account of events. We investigate all reports. False reports by riders also result in consequences for them.

### Q: Will I know who reported me?

**A:** No, reporter information is kept confidential to protect riders.

### Q: How long does a suspension last?
