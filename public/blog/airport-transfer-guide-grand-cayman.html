        <p>Landing at Owen Roberts International Airport (GCM) and wondering how to get to your hotel? You're not alone. It's one of the most common questions visitors ask when planning their trip to the Cayman Islands. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about airport transfers in Grand Cayman.</p>

        <h2>About Owen Roberts International Airport</h2>

        <p>Owen Roberts International Airport is Grand Cayman's only commercial airport, located just east of George Town, the island's capital. Despite being a small island, the airport handles millions of passengers annually, with direct flights from major cities across North America, the Caribbean, and beyond.</p>

        <p>The airport is modern and well-organized, but compact. After clearing customs and immigration, you'll find yourself in the arrivals hall with easy access to ground transportation options.</p>

        <h2>Transportation Options from the Airport</h2>

        <h3>1. Drift - The Smart Choice</h3>

        <p>Drift is the most convenient way to get from the airport to anywhere on the island. Here's why thousands of visitors choose Drift:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Upfront Pricing</strong> — Know exactly what you'll pay before you book</li>
            <li><strong>No Cash Needed</strong> — Pay securely through the app</li>
            <li><strong>Verified Drivers</strong> — All drivers are background-checked locals</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Tracking</strong> — Watch your driver arrive on the map</li>
            <li><strong>No Waiting in Lines</strong> — Your driver comes to you</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Pro Tip: Download Before You Fly</h3>
            <p>Download the Drift app before your flight. Once you land, connect to the free airport WiFi, open the app, and book your ride while you wait for your luggage. Your driver will be there by the time you exit!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Traditional Taxis</h3>

        <p>Taxis are available outside the arrivals terminal. While convenient, there are some things to consider:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Fares are government-regulated but can be higher than app-based alternatives</li>
            <li>Cash is often preferred</li>
            <li>Prices may vary based on number of passengers and luggage</li>
            <li>Availability can be limited during peak arrival times</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Hotel Shuttles</h3>

        <p>Some resorts and hotels offer airport shuttle services. Check with your accommodation before arrival. Keep in mind:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Usually need to be arranged in advance</li>
            <li>May operate on fixed schedules</li>
            <li>Costs vary by property</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Rental Cars</h3>

        <p>If you plan to explore the island extensively, renting a car might make sense. Rental agencies are located at the airport. Remember:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Driving is on the LEFT side of the road in Cayman</li>
            <li>You'll need a temporary Cayman driving permit</li>
            <li>Parking can be limited in George Town and Seven Mile Beach</li>
        </ul>

        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for a Smooth Airport Transfer</h2>

        <h3>Arriving During Peak Times</h3>
        <p>Grand Cayman sees the most arrivals between 1 PM and 6 PM when flights from major US cities land. During cruise ship days and high season (December-April), allow extra time for immigration and customs.</p>

        <h3>Currency</h3>
        <p>The Cayman Islands Dollar (KYD) is the local currency, but US dollars are widely accepted. With Drift, you pay through the app, so you don't need cash immediately upon arrival.</p>

        <h3>Connectivity</h3>
        <p>The airport has free WiFi, making it easy to book your Drift ride. Most international phone plans work in Cayman, but check with your carrier about roaming charges.</p>

        <h3>Luggage</h3>
        <p>Standard Drift rides can accommodate typical vacation luggage. If you're traveling with oversized items like surfboards or golf clubs, mention this in the app so your driver can be prepared.</p>

        <h2>Why Locals Recommend Drift</h2>

        <blockquote>
            "When friends visit the island, I always tell them to download Drift before they land. It's the easiest way to get from the airport to anywhere. Plus, our drivers actually know the island — not just the main roads, but the shortcuts and hidden gems too."
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Returning to the Airport</h2>

        <p>Drift works just as well for your departure. Book a ride from your hotel to Owen Roberts International Airport with the same ease. We recommend:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Booking 2-3 hours before your flight for international departures</li>
            <li>Allowing extra time during peak season</li>
            <li>Confirming your pickup time the night before</li>
        </ul>
