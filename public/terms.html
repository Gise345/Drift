            <h2>1. What is Drift?</h2>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Critical Understanding:</strong> Drift is a peer-to-peer community technology platform that connects independent individuals who wish to share private carpool arrangements. Drift is NOT a transportation company, taxi service, rideshare operator, or for-hire transport provider.
            </div>

            <h3>1.1 What Drift Is:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A digital marketplace connecting independent users</li>
                <li>Mobile application software for communication and coordination</li>
                <li>Suggested cost contribution calculators based on distance/time</li>
                <li>Optional payment processing facilitation between users</li>
                <li>Platform infrastructure maintenance and support services</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 What Drift Is NOT:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A transportation service provider</li>
                <li>An employer of drivers</li>
                <li>A taxi company or for-hire service</li>
                <li>A vehicle fleet operator</li>
                <li>A dispatcher of rides</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the Drift mobile application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

            <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>To use Drift, you must meet the following age requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Riders:</strong> Must be at least 16 years old (legal age in Cayman Islands)</li>
                <li><strong>Drivers:</strong> Must be at least 21 years old with a valid Cayman Islands driver's license</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have the legal capacity to enter into binding agreements</li>
                <li>Not be prohibited from using the service under applicable law</li>
                <li>Provide accurate and complete information when creating an account</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How Drift Works</h2>

            <h3>4.1 The Three-Party Structure:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Riders:</strong> Independent individuals seeking carpool arrangements who make voluntary requests and choose which drivers to connect with</li>
                <li><strong>Drivers:</strong> Independent individuals offering to share rides who voluntarily accept or decline requests. Drivers are NOT employees, contractors, or agents of Drift</li>
                <li><strong>Drift:</strong> Provides technology infrastructure only and does NOT participate in the actual carpool arrangement</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.2 Connection Process:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rider enters pickup location and destination</li>
                <li>Platform suggests nearby available drivers based on GPS proximity</li>
                <li>Rider selects preferred driver from available options</li>
                <li>Driver receives notification and voluntarily chooses to accept or decline</li>
                <li>If both parties agree, they connect for a private carpool arrangement</li>
                <li>Private carpool takes place (arranged between users, not by Drift)</li>
                <li>Cost-sharing payment processed through the app</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Important:</strong> At NO point does Drift dispatch, assign, mandate, or control any aspect of the ride itself. All arrangements are voluntary, private agreements between independent users.
            </div>

            <h2>5. Cost-Sharing & Payments</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Suggested Contributions:</h3>
            <p>Drift provides SUGGESTED cost contribution ranges based on distance, time, and fuel costs. These are suggestions only—not mandatory fares. Final amounts are voluntary agreements between driver and rider.</p>

            <h3>5.2 Platform Service Fee:</h3>
            <p>A 19% platform service fee is applied to all cost-sharing contributions processed through the app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>~4% covers payment processing (Stripe fees, transaction security, PCI compliance)</li>
                <li>~15% covers platform maintenance (servers, APIs, engineering, support, safety features)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.3 Mandatory In-App Payment:</h3>
            <p>For the safety and protection of all users, ALL cost-sharing payments must be processed through the in-app payment system. This protects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Drivers from:</strong> Non-payment, cash disputes, handling cash risks</li>
                <li><strong>Riders from:</strong> Price changes mid-ride, payment disputes, cash handling risks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cash payments are not permitted and may result in account suspension.</p>

            <h2>6. Rider Terms</h2>
            <p>As a rider, you agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide accurate pickup and destination information</li>
                <li>Be ready at the pickup location when the driver arrives</li>
                <li>Treat drivers with respect</li>
                <li>Pay all agreed cost-sharing contributions through the app</li>
                <li>Not engage in illegal activities during rides</li>
                <li>Wear seatbelts as required by law</li>
                <li>Not damage vehicles or driver property</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Driver Terms</h2>
            <p>As a driver, you acknowledge that you are an independent individual, NOT an employee or contractor of Drift. You agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain a valid Cayman Islands driver's license</li>
                <li>Carry appropriate vehicle insurance (verify it covers carpooling)</li>
                <li>Keep your vehicle in safe operating condition</li>
                <li>Provide rides safely and professionally</li>
                <li>Follow all applicable Cayman Islands traffic laws</li>
                <li>Not discriminate against riders</li>
                <li>Complete required background checks and verification</li>
                <li>Be solely responsible for your own tax obligations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7.1 Driver Independence:</h3>
            <p>Drift does NOT:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set your schedule or working hours</li>
                <li>Require minimum acceptance rates</li>
                <li>Mandate how you operate your vehicle</li>
                <li>Dictate routes or driving behavior</li>
                <li>Provide vehicles or equipment</li>
                <li>Supervise your day-to-day activities</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Safety Features</h2>
            <p>Drift provides safety features including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SOS emergency button</li>

                <li>24/7 platform support for urgent issues</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. Liability & Insurance</h2>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Important:</strong> Since all rides are private arrangements between independent users, liability falls on the parties involved—not on Drift.
            </div>

            <h3>9.1 Driver Liability:</h3>
            <p>Drivers are solely responsible for:</p>

                <li>Traffic violations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Riders acknowledge they are entering a private carpool arrangement with another independent user and assume all associated risks.</p>

            <h3>9.3 Drift Liability:</h3>
            <p>Drift, as a technology platform provider, is NOT liable for:</p>

                <li>Driver or rider conduct</li>

                <li>Route selection or driving decisions</li>
                <li>Payment disputes between users</li>
                <li>Any consequences of private arrangements made through the platform</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>9.4 Insurance Requirements:</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Drivers should verify their insurance covers carpooling/ride-sharing activities</li>

            <h2>11. Ratings and Reviews</h2>
